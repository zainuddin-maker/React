# **REACT JS**

A javacript library for building user interfaces.

Why we use react instead of just javascript?

- we ust describe action by action ( imperative approach) an can reach the limit.

- as developer we must take care

- with react we can make custom component , and using that over and over again .

so react.js is 
- A client side Javascript library
- All about building modern, reactive user interfaces for the web.
- Declarative,component-focused approach.
